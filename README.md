# TNHScoreBreakdown

Custom overlay for [H3Status](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/tree/main)

- Displays a breakdown of the score for Take & Hold upon run completion

- Plays a sound when the stealth or hitless bonus is lost

- Maintains the features from the base TNHScoreLog

## Usage

Place the folder containing files in the [`Overlays` folder from H3Status](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/tree/main/Overlays). You must also have [`TNHScoreLog`](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/tree/main/Overlays/TNHScoreLog) in the Overlays folder, as it uses the same assets.

In OBS, set up a Browser with Local file set and `scoreBreakdown.html` as the Local file.

Set the Width and Height to the size of the Video Output Resolution.
